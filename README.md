# 🎲 Pig Game

A fun project to practice JavaScript:  
The classic two-player dice game.

---

## 🚀 About the Project
This game is built with HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript.  
The idea is inspired by the JavaScript course by [Jonas Schmedtmann](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-javascript-course/), but the coding and implementation have been done independently.

## ✨ Rules & Features
- The game is played between two players.  
- On each turn, a player can roll the dice using the Roll Dice button:  
  - The rolled values are added to the player’s Current Score.  
  - If a 1 is rolled, the Current Score is reset to 0, and the turn passes to the next player.  
- By clicking Hold:  
  - The Current Score is added to the player’s Total Score.  
  - The turn then passes to the next player.  
- The first player to reach 30 points wins the game 🎉  
- A New Game button is available to reset and start again at any time.
